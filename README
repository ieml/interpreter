This project uses ant to build (http://ant.apache.org/)
once it is in your PATH, simply do 'ant' to build the project
From there issuing ./start.sh on the command line should get you going (might need a chmod +x)

For now all ./start.sh does is issuing

java -cp ieml.jar:lib/antlr-runtime-3.1.2.jar:lib/dom4j-1.6.1.jar:lib/commons-io-1.3.1.jar org.ieml.Interpreter test.usl

which invokes java, puts a few jars in the classpath and starts the interpreter passing it the path of a usl to parse

Hence, obviously, change the contents of that usl to change the interpreter's output.

We'll add true interactivity very soon
